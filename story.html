            <div class="block-41-text">
              <p>I am a final year student at SRCC, India's No.1 Ranked college for commerce and a dream for many. But you know, things always look greener on the other side, and in my case, it was no different. Being a small-town guy, I felt like a black sheep who was never going to fit there. Seeing people getting into good societies and securing tier 1 (top) Internships triggered a sense of lagging in me, and knowingly or unknowingly, I became a victim of peer pressure.
              </br>  To succeed in this competitive world, I decided to push myself to move to PG, hoping for a better and balanced life, but living without my family for the first time made the situation worse instead of improving it. I started suffering from depression, and I always felt a need to talk to someone and share my feelings. I wanted to tell someone how I felt, but the fear of judgment stopped the inner me.
            </br>  Soon, I went through the treatment, and after getting back to daily life, I decided to found 'There For You' - a place where no one will be judged based upon their feelings and emotions. We aim to provide affordable, easily accessible, and quality treatment to college students to make sure no one ever suffers in silence anymore, the way I did.</p>

              <p>Hello, I am Charu Gupta, student at SRCC. I believe almost everyone of us goes through a tough phase in our lives, where we require more self care, self love and self support. I also went through the same, and the reason was undue peer pressure and related stressful situations. 
              </br>
                It is indeed a hard fact to absorb that most of us, didn't even realise that we need healing to cure this as well, likewise we require for any physical unwell-ness, and so didn't I. 
              </br>
                There for You's vision and mission is close to my heart and would like to fulfill it to the core so that, people in large can accept the mental illness and the treatment it's require without any second thought.

              <p>Hello! I am Yashi Gangwar, and currently am pursuing B.Com. honours from SRCC. In one way or another, college life brought a lot of new challenges and it was difficult . But with the support of my family and friends, I was able to make it through and the journey is still in continuation.</br> 
                So yeah I feel it's difficult but one has to understand that he/she is not alone and it's okay to ask for help and take a break. It has been a great experience working with TFY for the past months. The team members are amazing and hoping to learn a lot from them.

              <p>I have recently graduated from Lady Shri Ram College for Women. I came across There for You on LinkedIn and the initiative clicked for me. I decided to go ahead with it as I have had struggles of my own which I have been able to overcome as I had few amazing set of people in my life. I have faced many ups and downs and the pandemic also led to trigger my anxiety. This platform seemed like a perfect place for me where I would look upto to seek help and I feel privileged to be here so that I can help others struggling through their own battles with bare minimum I could do. 
                There for You felt like my my safe space and therefore I decided to go ahead with it.</p>

              <p>Life was a cakewalk for me for the first 17 years of my life but things changed when I had to leave my hometown for St. Xavier’s College, Mumbai, to pursue under graduation. That is when life opened my eyes to the real world, and I discovered how underestimated is the power of having a healthy mind. For me, the only thing that remained constant through all those years was my love for myself, which I found missing in people for themselves. I would see people struggling with mental health issues and more so, talking about the issues they had. Soon I realized that this world needs to be free of the taboos of the words “Mental Health”, and that is when I decided to associate myself with "There For You" for the one thing we had in common, the mission to create awareness about mental health. 
              </br>
                ‘There For You’ is one such initiative that has the vision to normalize talking about one's mental health and promote empathy, compassion, and awareness about mental health. We at TFY are here to hear what goes unheard and unsaid and provide peer support to those who need it because we believe that this world needs to be a better place for everyone to live in!

              <p>Hi I’m Chahat Budhiraja, the Marketing Manager of There For You. I’m currently a second year student pursuing Computer Science Majors from Hansraj College, Delhi University. I was a pampered kid at home and so it was extremely difficult moving from home to an alien land for college. The initial months were extremely tough and there were days when I had suffered from anxiety. It was difficult opening up with unknown faces. But eventually I realised that most of us have left homes and moved out for college, for work, or for something or the other. I started opening up with people and made a lot of friends. I always felt the urge of joining a mental health organisation and helping people as much as I can. My friends used to say that I’m good at counselling people. Though I had a pretty good life, I always felt that something was missing. It was towards June that I realised that I have high functioning anxiety and it took me time to come out of it. So when I got to know about There For You, I so wanted to be a part of it and help people with all my capability. These past months with There For You have been nothing but wholesome. It’s been amazing interacting with people and getting to know them better and helping them to come out of their shells. There For You isn’t only an organisation but an emotion. It has helped me to grow as an individual and made me overcome my fears and complexities. Working with such talented people has been a beautiful experience. With the coming years, I look forward to assist more and more people with every possible way and make this society a better place to live in.</p>
